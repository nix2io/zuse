  <strong>The Zuse Language</strong><br />
  <sub>functional language representing symbols to compute the world's information</sub>
</p>

## The vision

This is not meant to be used to write long complex programs, it should be used for small individual functions that are able to be combined to create greater functionality.

I am basing this project off of the wolfram language, however my goal is to make this opensource and allow people to create their own functions to add to the codebase.

### The Future

This will be the bases for future Nix2 projects that can dynamically generate Zuse code. 

## Internal Structure

The internal structure that interpreters use can be found [here](./internal_structure.md)

## Standard Library

The standard library of builtin functions is [here](./std/)

## The Name

Named after [Konrad Zuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse)
