# Zuse Lang Specification
The Zuse Language is a functional language representing symbols to compute the world's information.

## My vision

This is not meant to be used to write long complex programs, it should be used for small individual functions that are able to be combined to create greater functionality.

I am basing this project off of the wolfram language, however my goal is to make this opensource and allow people to create their own functions to add to the codebase.

## Standard Library

The standard library of builtin functions is [here](./std/)

## The Name

Named after [Konrad Zuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse)
