  <strong>The Zuse Language</strong><br />
  <sub>functional language representing symbols to compute the world's information</sub>
</p>

## Abstract

The Zuse language is not meant to be like a stardard programming language, rather, Zuse code is meant to be generated by other programs and be able to run through non-language-specific interpreters.

## Internal Structure

The internal structure that interpreters use can be found [here](./internal_structure.md)

## Standard Library

The standard library of builtin functions is [here](./std/)

## About

### Inspiration

I am basing this project off of the Wolfram Language, however my goal is to make this opensource and allow people to create their own functions to add to the codebase.

### The Name

Named after [Konrad Zuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse)
