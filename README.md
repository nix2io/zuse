## Abstract

The Zuse language is not meant to be like a stardard programming language, rather, Zuse code is meant to be generated by other programs and be able to run through interpreters, written in other languages. This also allows you to reuse already written code to use in combination with Zuse code.

The language consists of only functions, this is done because you can represent the function that gets called, along with its arguments, in a format such as JSON or YAML. Executing a function in Zuse is represented with an array, the first element being the function name, and the second element being an object of arguments as shown here in YAML:

```yaml
- MyFunction
- foo: bar
  key: value
```
or in JSON:
```jsonc
[
  "MyFunction",
  {
    "foo": "bar",
    "key": "value"
  }
]
```

## Interpreters

Here is the list of offical and non-offical Zuse interpreters.

### Offical

-   [Typescript](https://github.com/nix2io/zuse-interpreter-typescript)
-   [Python](https://github.com/nix2io/zuse-interpreter-python)

## More Info

### Inspiration

I am basing this project off of the Wolfram Language, however my goal is to make this opensource and allow people to create their own functions to add to the codebase.

### The Name

Named after [Konrad Zuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse)
